🫁 Lung Cancer Detection Using CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify lung cancer from grayscale medical images (e.g., CT scans or X-rays). The model is trained to distinguish between different types of lung cancer using a custom dataset organized into labeled folders.
